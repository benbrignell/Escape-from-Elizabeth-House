# Escape from Elizabeth House

A game I built as a leaving present for my colleagues, using easeljs, canvas, based on [David Rousset's XNA port](http://blogs.msdn.com/b/davrous/archive/2011/09/09/html5-platformer-the-complete-port-of-the-xna-game-to-lt-canvas-gt-with-easeljs.aspx "Title") but with sequential levels added (instead of the default random levels).
